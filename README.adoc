== Features

* Uses the link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/docker-alpine-base[Docker Alpine Base] image.
* Installs link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
* Updates link:https://rubygems.org[RubyGems].

== Requirements

. link:https://www.docker.com[Docker].

== Setup

To set up the project, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/docker-alpine-ruby.git
cd docker-alpine-ruby
git checkout 0.6.3
----

== Usage

All versions of this image can be found on
link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bkuhlmann/alpine-ruby[Docker Hub]. The image can be
pulled as follows:

[source,bash]
----
docker pull bkuhlmann/alpine-ruby:latest  # <= Pull latest version.
docker pull bkuhlmann/alpine-ruby:0.6.3   # <= Pull specific version.
----

You can also build on top of this image via your `Dockerfile`:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM bkuhlmann/alpine-ruby:latest  # <= Latest version.
FROM bkuhlmann/alpine-ruby:0.6.3   # <= Specific version.
----

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/docker-alpine-ruby.git
cd docker-alpine-ruby
----

To build, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/build
----

To use the console, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

To release a new version (i.e. `1.2.3`), run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/release 1.2.3
----

Releasing without specifying a version will default to tagging the image as the `latest` image. Best
practice is to release both the specific tag and update the latest tag as well. Example:

[source,bash]
----
bin/release
bin/release 1.2.3
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
ruby --version
----
